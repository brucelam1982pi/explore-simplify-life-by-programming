Can stuff in broccoli and Brussels sprouts prevent COVID-19?

   A chemical derived from a compound found in broccoli and other
   cruciferous plants may offer a potentially new and potent weapon
   against the viruses that cause COVID-19 and the common cold, new
   evidence suggests.

   COVID-19 has already killed more than 6 million people worldwide, and
   studies have shown that common colds cost an estimated economic loss of
   $25 billion in the US alone each year.

   In the study in the journal [38]Communications Biology, scientists
   showed that [39]sulforaphane, a plant-derived chemical, known as a
   phytochemical, already found to have anti-cancer effects, can inhibit
   the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19,
   and another human coronavirus in cells and mice.

   While the results are promising, the researchers caution the public
   against rushing to buy sulforaphane supplements available online and in
   stores, noting that studies of sulforaphane in humans are necessary
   before the chemical is proven effective, and emphasizing the lack of
   regulation covering such supplements.

   Sulforaphane’s natural precursor is particularly abundant in broccoli,
   cabbage, kale, and Brussels sprouts. First identified as a
   “chemopreventive” compound decades ago, natural sulforaphane is derived
   from common food sources, such as broccoli seeds, sprouts, and mature
   plants, as well as infusions of sprouts or seeds for drinking.

   Previous studies, including those at Johns Hopkins Medicine, have shown
   sulforaphane to have cancer and infection-prevention properties by way
   of interfering with certain cellular processes.

   “When the COVID-19 pandemic started, our multidisciplinary research
   teams switched our investigations of other viruses and bacteria to
   focus on a potential treatment for what was then a challenging new
   virus for us,” says senior author Lori Jones-Brando, an assistant
   professor of pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of
   Medicine.

   “I was screening multiple compounds for anti-[40]coronavirus activity
   and decided to try sulforaphane since it has shown modest activity
   against other microbial agents that we study.” The researchers used
   purified, synthetic sulforaphane purchased from commercial chemical
   suppliers in their experiments.

   In one experiment, the research team first exposed cells to
   sulforaphane for one to two hours before infecting the cells with
   SARS-CoV-2 and the common cold coronavirus, HCoV-OC43. They found that
   low micromolar (µM) concentrations of sulforaphane (2.4–31 µM) reduced
   the replication by 50% of six strains of SARS-CoV-2, including the
   Delta and Omicron variants, as well as that of the HCoV-OC43
   coronavirus. The investigators also observed similar results with cells
   that had been previously infected with the viruses, in which the
   protective effects of sulforaphane were seen even with an already
   established virus infection.

   The group also examined the effects of sulforaphane when combined with
   remdesivir, an antiviral medication used to shorten the recovery of
   hospitalized adults with COVID-19 infections.

   They found that [41]remdesivir inhibited 50% of the replication of
   HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 at 22 µM and 4 µM, respectively. Further, the
   research team reports that sulforaphane and remdesivir interacted
   synergistically at several combination ratios to reduce by 50% the
   viral burden in cells infected with HCoV-OC43 or SARS-CoV-2.

   In this context, synergism means that lower doses of both sulforaphane
   (for example, 1.6–3.2 µM) and remdesivir (for example, 0.5–3.2 µM),
   when combined, are more effective against the viruses than either
   applied alone.

   “Historically, we have learned that the combination of multiple
   compounds in a treatment regimen is an ideal strategy to treat viral
   infections,” says Alvaro Ordonez, first author of the paper, and an
   assistant professor of pediatrics. “The fact that sulforaphane and
   remdesivir work better combined than alone is very encouraging.”

   The researchers then conducted studies in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2
   infection. They found that giving 30 milligrams of sulforaphane per
   kilogram of body weight to mice before infecting them with the virus
   significantly decreased the loss of body weight that’s typically
   associated with virus infection (7.5% decrease).

   Further, the pretreatment resulted in a statistically significant
   decrease in both the viral load, or amount of virus, in the lungs (17%
   decrease) and upper respiratory tract (9% decrease) as well as the
   amount of lung injury (29% decrease) compared with infected mice that
   were not given sulforaphane. The compound also decreased inflammation
   in the lungs, protecting the cells from a hyperactive immune response
   that seems to be one of the driving factors that has caused many people
   to die from COVID-19.

   “What we found is that sulforaphane is antiviral against HCoV-OC43 and
   SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses while also helping control the immune
   response,” Ordonez says. “This multifunctional activity makes it an
   interesting compound to use against these viral infections, as well as
   those caused by other human coronaviruses.”

   The team plans to conduct studies in humans to evaluate if sulforaphane
   can be effective in preventing or treating these infections.

   “Despite the introduction of vaccines and other medications that can
   have side effects, effective antiviral agents are still necessary to
   prevent and treat COVID-19, particularly considering the potential
   effects of new coronavirus variants arising in the population,”
   Jones-Brando says. “Sulforaphane could be a promising treatment that is
   less expensive, safe, and readily available commercially.”

   Additional coauthors are from Johns Hopkins. The National Institutes of
   Health, Mercatus Center, the Center for Infection and Inflammation
   Imaging Research at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and
   the Stanley Medical Research Institute funded the work.

   Jones-Brando, Ordonez, and coauthors Robert H. Yolken and Sanjay K.
   Jain are co-inventors on a pending patent application filed by Johns
   Hopkins University. All other authors have no competing interests.
